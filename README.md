### CPMA-Install-Script

**Installation Dependencies:**

You'll need either `wget` or `curl`, and `unzip`

You'll also need to supply your own Quake 3 pak files. At least `pak0.pk3`, but you'll likely want `pak1.pk3` through `pak8.pk3` as well. These can be copied out of a full retail install on Quake 3 or [found elsewhere online](https://www.google.com/search?q=+pak0.pk3+intitle:index++457M).

**Install location and information:**

Game is installed to `~/.local/share/cpma/`

Quake 3 pak files go in `~/.local/share/cpma/baseq3/`

Custom HUD files will go into `~/.local/share/cpma/cpma/hud/`

Custom config files will go in `~/.q3a/cpma/`
