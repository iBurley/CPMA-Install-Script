### CPMA-Install-Script

**Installation Dependencies:**

You'll need either `wget` or `curl`, and `unzip`

You'll also need to supply your own pak0.pk3. This can be copied out of a full retail install on Quake 3 or [found elsewhere online](https://www.google.com/search?q=+pak0.pk3+intitle:index++457M).
